For this project, we produced simulated samples of an Electroweak SUSY process and determined whether the CMS detector would be sensitive to the resulting signal. 

In the sample production process takes input template cards, creates a gridpack with relevant Madgraph code, decays the events in Pythia, and streamlines the resulting data into nTuples using code from CMS's (inelastic dark matter) group.

We can also verify the generator and reconstruction-level kinematics of our samples to ensure that our simulations represent the desires physical processes.

Lastly, we apply reconstruction-level cuts and determine the dimuon mass distribution, largely using code developed by the IDM group.
